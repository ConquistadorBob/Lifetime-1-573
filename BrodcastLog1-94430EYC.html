It is with great honor we say goodbye to our largest expeditionary force yet. Our solar arrays have parted for the largest fleet our system has ever amassed, to now leave on our longest journey yet. 500 ships will march on for countless generations in the path to destination system 1, planet 3. With their success, our civilization may last until the end of all things. May they know their place in all things.
