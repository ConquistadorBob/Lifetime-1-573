<p class="paragraph" > I know my logs are looked at by you. But I must document what I believe, even if the lord captain believes I am misunderstanding.

<p class="paragraph" >  I believe I have begun to detect radio transmissions from destination planet 3. This would be most unusual, we expected it would take almost 500 lifetimes before the creatures on that planet could develop any comparable technology. The lord captain remains very skeptical and refuses to pass on this information to The Guides. He says this planet has been without manufactured technology for billions of rotations, and it will remain so for thousands more. Our Guides estimate we will not reach the planet in our lifetime, but our children likely will. What more could the creatures of that planet develop in that time? Could our mission be ruined? I will continue to track these transmissions and report to the Lord Captain.
