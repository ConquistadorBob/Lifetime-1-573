<p class="paragraph" >Our mission is almost at its final stage, but I retain my fathers worry. The technology these creatures on the destination planet possess is progressing much faster than on our home planet. Our probes have been being shot down when they try to land on the destination planet. They have learned about the power of the desired element. They have sent out long distance probes of their own. Our communications team received a message to broadcast from Sailor 1 Guide;  we are now to station in orbit around planet 4 of the system and wait to land on planet 3. I fear these last minute complications may lead to me being unable to see the destination planet in my lifetime as my father wanted.
